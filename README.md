# Google Trends Data with R

- Omar Trejo
- January, 2017

## Objective

Extract data from Google Trends using R.

## Considerations

There's an unpublished threshold limit for API calls for Google Trends data.
That's why a variety of functions are provided to try to deal with this. However
the limit seems to be sticky for quite a bit of time.
